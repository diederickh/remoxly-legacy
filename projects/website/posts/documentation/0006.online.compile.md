## Compile Remoxly

### Compile on Mac

Follow these basic steps to setup a development environment on Mac. You
only need to follow these steps when you want to develop on Remoxly itself.
For example when you want to create new widgets. First, create a directory
and clone the repository:

````sh
$ mkdir remoxly
$ cd remoxly
$ git clone git@git.github.com:roxlu/remoxly.git
````

Download [this setup file](/downloads/setup_mac.sh) and save it into the directory
where you clones Remoxly. Then open a terminal and execute the script.

````sh
$ chmod 777 setup_mac.sh
$ ./setup_mac.sh
````

Now you're ready to build the projects! For example compile the gui project:

````sh
$ cd projects\gui\build
$ ./release.sh
````
